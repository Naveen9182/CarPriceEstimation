**Car Price Estimation
**
In this project, I have leveraged Australian Car Prices data from Kaggle to estimate the prices of the cars based on the features like Brand, Year, Seats and Doors e.t.c., 
I implmented basic to advanced feature selection and regression modeling techniques to train and improve a regression model iteratively.
