Car Price Estimation


In this project, I have leveraged Australian Car Prices data from Kaggle to estimate the prices of the cars based on features like Brand, Year, Seats and Doors e.t.c., 
I implemented basic to advanced feature selection and regression modelling techniques to train and improve a regression model iteratively.
